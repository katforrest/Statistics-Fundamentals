## About

Logistic Regression_Multiple Variable_Wine Quality Data.ipynb is the final logistic regression model, and uses the winequality-red.csv dataset. 
I used a gradient descent algorithm to fit a logistic regression model to a dataset with 11 features. When testing it against the validation data, my model had 92% accuracy. 

The other notebooks I used to experiment and visualize different datasets.
