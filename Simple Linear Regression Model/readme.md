This is a simple linear regression model for multiple variables using gradeint descent.
I used sklearn functions to scale the data during processing, but implemented gradeint descent in my own code.
<li>Gradient Descent Linear Regression with Multiple Variables and Feature Scaling.ipynb</li>

I've included two datasets that can both be used with this model.
<p><li>houses.csv</li>
<li>medicalcosts.csv</li>
<br>

I've included two notebooks where I played around with the elements of linear regression and some (new to me) python functions.

<li>Random Data Generation.ipynb</li>
